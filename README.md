## Why V2 Saver Over Traditional Bookmarks?

### Traditional Browser Bookmarks: Limitations
- **Rigid folder hierarchy** that becomes unmanageable with scale
- **No tagging system** for flexible categorization
- **Limited search capabilities** - only title and URL matching
- **No reordering** within folders without manual drag-and-drop
- **No undo functionality** - deleted bookmarks are gone forever
- **Poor export/import** options with proprietary formats
- **No visual feedback** during organization
- **Zero metadata** beyond title and URL

| **Undo/Redo** | ‚ùå Not available | ‚úÖ 20-level undo history |
| **Pinning** | ‚ùå Not available | ‚úÖ Pin important items to top |
| **Import/Export** | HTML format only | Human-readable text format |
| **Context Menu** | Basic bookmarking | Quick-save with metadata |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | Limited | Full keyboard navigation |
| **Visual Feedback** | Minimal | Smooth animations & notifications |
